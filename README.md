# tk-houdini-flipbook

`tk-houdini-flipbook` is a Shotgun Toolkit app to create flipbooks of your current scene with the use of SGTK templates. It uses Nuke to create a preview file that is automatically uploaded to Shotgun and linked to a new version. `tk-houdini-fipbook` also includes a `slate.py` which mirrors the [tk-multi-reviewsubmission](https://github.com/nfa-vfxim/tk-multi-reviewsubmission) slate. This slate, by default, adds a frame at the beginning of the file to include some data about the version and user. It also adds a small semi-transparent bar at the top and bottom of the screen to reflect some more data.
